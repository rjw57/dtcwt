    """Perform a *n*-level DTCWT-3D decompostion on a 3D matrix *X*.

    :param X: 3D real array-like object
    :param nlevels: Number of levels of wavelet decomposition
    :param biort: Level 1 wavelets to use. See :py:func:`biort`.
    :param qshift: Level >= 2 wavelets to use. See :py:func:`qshift`.
    :param ext_mode: Extension mode. See below.
    :param discard_level_1: True if level 1 high-pass bands are to be discarded.

    :returns Yl: The real lowpass image from the final level
    :returns Yh: A tuple containing the complex highpass subimages for each level.

    Each element of *Yh* is a 4D complex array with the 4th dimension having
    size 28. The 3D slice ``Yh[l][:,:,:,d]`` corresponds to the complex higpass
    coefficients for direction d at level l where d and l are both 0-indexed.

    If *biort* or *qshift* are strings, they are used as an argument to the
    :py:func:`biort` or :py:func:`qshift` functions. Otherwise, they are
    interpreted as tuples of vectors giving filter coefficients. In the *biort*
    case, this should be (h0o, g0o, h1o, g1o). In the *qshift* case, this should
    be (h0a, h0b, g0a, g0b, h1a, h1b, g1a, g1b).

    There are two values for *ext_mode*, either 4 or 8. If *ext_mode* = 4,
    check whether 1st level is divisible by 2 (if not we raise a
    ``ValueError``). Also check whether from 2nd level onwards, the coefs can
    be divided by 4. If any dimension size is not a multiple of 4, append extra
    coefs by repeating the edges. If *ext_mode* = 8, check whether 1st level is
    divisible by 4 (if not we raise a ``ValueError``). Also check whether from
    2nd level onwards, the coeffs can be divided by 8. If any dimension size is
    not a multiple of 8, append extra coeffs by repeating the edges twice.

    If *discard_level_1* is True the highpass coefficients at level 1 will be
    discarded. (And, in fact, will never be calculated.) This turns the
    transform from being 8:1 redundant to being 1:1 redundant at the cost of
    no-longer allowing perfect reconstruction. If this option is selected then
    `Yh[0]` will be `None`. Note that :py:func:`dtwaveifm3` will accepts
    `Yh[0]` being `None` and will treat it as being zero.
