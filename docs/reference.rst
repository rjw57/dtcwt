API Reference
=============

Computing the DT-CWT
````````````````````

These functions provide API-level compatibility with MATLAB.

.. note::

    The functionality of ``dtwavexfm2b`` and ``dtwaveifm2b`` have been folded
    into ``dtwavexfm2`` and ``dtwaveifm2``. For convenience of porting MATLAB
    scripts, the original function names are available in the :py:mod:`dtcwt`
    module as aliases but they should not be used in new code.
