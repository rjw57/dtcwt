The dtcwt library
=================

This library provides support for computing 1D and 2D dual-tree complex wavelet
transforms and their inverse in Python.

The interface is intentionally similar to the existing MATLAB dual-tree complex
wavelet transform toolbox provided by `Prof. Nick Kingsbury
<http://www-sigproc.eng.cam.ac.uk/~ngk/>`_. This library is intended to ease
the porting of algorithms written in using this toolbox from MATLAB to Python.

The original toolbox is copyrighted and there are some restrictions on use
which are outlined in the file
:download:`ORIGINAL_README.txt<../ORIGINAL_README.txt>`.

Aside from portions directly derived from the original MATLAB toolbox, any
additions in this library and this documentation are licensed under the
2-clause BSD licence as documented in the file
:download:`COPYING.txt<../COPYING.txt>`.
