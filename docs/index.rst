The dtcwt library
=================

This library provides support for computing 1D, 2D and 3D dual-tree complex
wavelet transforms and their inverse in Python along with some signal
processing algorithms which make use of the DTCWT.

Features of note
````````````````

The features of the ``dtcwt`` library are:

* 1D, 2D and 3D forward and inverse Dual-tree Complex Wavelet Transform
  implementations.
* API similarity with the DTCWT MATLAB toolbox.
* Automatic selection of single versus double precision calculation.
* Built-in support for the most common complex wavelet families.
